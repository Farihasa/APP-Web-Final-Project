            <h1><em> Rumi dance and quotes</em></h1>
            <p>Rumi’s poetry is based on Sufi mysticism, spirituality and most importantly, love. Sufis dance “like nobody’s watching, love like they’ve never been hurt and live like it’s heaven on earth”, as a wise man once said.</p>
            <p>However, according to Sufism, there is indeed someone watching – God, and love can never hurt since there is no love without sacrifice. But Sufis dance like there is no tomorrow and dancing is the core of their teaching.

                Whosoever knoweth the power of the dance, dwelleth in God. Without love, all worship is a burden, all dancing is a chore, all music is mere noise.
                
                – Rumi
                Dance and poetry have one thing in common – freedom, as mortals call it. 13th-century Persian poet Rumi would describe dance as connecting to our true essence. When we dance, we free ourselves.</p>

                <h2>Keep watching a part of this beatiful dance!</h2>
